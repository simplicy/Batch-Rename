# Batch Renamer 

This is a simple rust program I made using Rust and Iced for the GUI. This tool allows you to select a directory and remove up to 10 characters from the name for all files in that directory. 
For example, if you have a dir with files named 001-RecordingForEvent1.mp4, 002-RecordingForEvent2.mp4, and so on... you can rename every file to remove the 00X- from all filenames.
